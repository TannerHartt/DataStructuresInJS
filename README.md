This project also contains a collection of utility functions that can be found in the functions.js file.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repo:

        git clone https://github.com/TannerHartt/DataStructuresInJS

2.  Install dependencies:

        npm install

3.  Run live server:

        npm run dev

4.  Run unit tests with or without code coverage:

        npm test

        or

        npm run coverage

The server will be running at localhost:5173 but wont be necessary to open.

The functions and algorithms are tested using the Vite testing framework Vitest and not using the live server. The server is used primarily for live debugging.
